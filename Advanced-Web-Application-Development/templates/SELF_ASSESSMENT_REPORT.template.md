# SELF_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md — template

Every submission contains this file, at the root of the zip. Score yourself against the **rubric of that assignment**, criterion by criterion.

The total you write here goes into the name of your zip: `<StudentID>_<total>.zip`, or `<StudentID1>-<StudentID2>-<StudentID3>_<total>.zip` for group work.

## What to write

```markdown
# Self-assessment — IA#1

**Submitted by:** `<student ID>` — `<full name>` _(group work: one line per member)_

**Total I claim:** 82/100

| Criterion                | Max | I claim | Evidence                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contract                 | 25  | 22      | spec.md §Contract — endpoints, payloads, 3 status codes  |
| Acceptance criteria      | 25  | 20      | AC1—AC4; AC4 has no concrete value yet                   |
| Edge cases and non-goals | 20  | 18      | §Errors covers 4 of the 5; non-goals written             |
| Implementability         | 20  | 14      | 2 behaviour questions came back: rounding, who may split |
| Revision                 | 10  | 8       | spec-revised.md answers both, see the diff               |

### What I did not manage

AC4 ("limits") is still a wish I could not decide the page size without knowing the menu size, and I did not ask.

### What I would do differently

Write the non-goals first. Two of the questions I received were about things I had already decided not to build, but never wrote down.
```

## Rules

- **Evidence must point at something:** a file, a section, a commit, a test name. "I did this well" is not evidence.
- The section **What I did not manage** is scored as honesty, not as failure. An empty one on an imperfect submission reads worse than a frank paragraph.
- The number in the file name must equal the total in this table. If they disagree, the table wins.
- Your self-score does not set your mark - but an inaccurate one costs you. See **Honesty adjustment** below, and in the rubric of every assignment.

## Honesty adjustment

Your self-assessment is compared with the mark you actually earn. The gap is your total minus the mark, on the same 100-point scale.

| Gap                            | Adjustment                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| within ±10                     | none — this is normal calibration                   |
| +11 to +20                     | -3                                                  |
| +21 to +30                     | -6                                                  |
| more than +30                  | -10                                                 |
| -21 or worse                   | -3 — read the rubric before you score yourself down |
| no `SELF_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md` | -10, and the filename total is ignored              |

- A criterion you claim with no evidence line counts as claimed-and-not-done for this comparison.
- The adjustment never takes a submission below 0.
- Scoring yourself honestly low costs you nothing inside ±10. Claiming marks you did not earn costs more than the marks would have been worth.
